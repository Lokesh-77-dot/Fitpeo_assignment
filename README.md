FitPeo Automation Tester Assignment

Requirements to execute the code - Eclipse IDE, Selenium JAR, ChormeDriver exe

To excecute my Automation script you need to follow below steps

1- Create a Java Project in Eclipse

2- Create a Package inside it

3- Create a java class and copy paste the code from src/com/fitpeoAssignment/FitpeoAssignment.java

4- Add the Selenium jar in ClassPath

5- Lastly run by right clicking and run as java apllication

I have used Thread.sleep() only for demonstration purpose as it will slow down the execution of my automated tests and can help make the actions more visible and understandable in the screen recording.. I am well aware of the fact that using Thread.sleep() generally not recommended in professional automation scripts because it can make my tests less efficient and more prone to timing issues.
